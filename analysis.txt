Unscramble Computer Science Problems

Run time analysis (Worst-Case Big-O Notation) 

Task0: efficiency = O(1), because the run time stays constant (does not change as a function of the input)

Task1: efficiency = O(n^3), because there are 3 loops (largest loop)

Task2: efficiency = O(n^2) because the "for + in" iteration used in my code is 2 loops (largest loop)

Task3: efficiency = O(n), because there is 1 loop (largest loop)

Task4: efficiency = O(n * log n), which is the Python built-in [sort] algorithm's average efficiency
