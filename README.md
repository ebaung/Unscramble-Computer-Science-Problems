# Unscramble-Computer-Science-Problems
Project 1 of 4 in Udacity's Data Structures and Algorithms nanodegree. This project, labelled "P0", is comprised of 5 tasks, Task0 through Task4. The objective is to open, sort, and return data from 2 csv files, text.csv and calls.csv. Description of each task is given in each .py file.

Contents:
The solution files are the .py files
The .ipynb are given as the "working" or "scratch" files used to build up the final solution. 

Testing the .py files in Jupyter Notebook:
The file "Test .py files.ipynb" is provided as a convenient way to run the 5 Task_.py files within Jupyter notebook. Just a caveat: Make sure you run each cell one at a time. Don't run all cells at once.  This can cause one or more .py files to run incorrectly or incompletely (in particular, Task2.py doesn't behave nicely when all 5 Task cells are run simultaneously).
